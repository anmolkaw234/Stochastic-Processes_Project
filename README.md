# Estimating the range of a Tracking Device using Markov Chain

We aim to show, how the range of tracking devices can be estimated using the Markov Chain.
An effective range system is critical for optimizing the performance and reliability of tracking systems.

# Challenges

Accurate Range Estimation
- Develop a method to accurately estimate the range within which a tracking device can reliably operate.
- Focus on specific types of tracking devices, such as GPS trackers or RFID tags.
