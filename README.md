# Estimating the range of a Tracking Device using Markov Chain

We aim to show, how the range of tracking devices can be estimated using the Markov Chain.
An effective range system is critical for optimizing the performance and reliability of tracking systems.

## Challenges

### Accurate Range Estimation
- Develop a method to accurately estimate the range within which a tracking device can reliably operate.
- Focus on specific types of tracking devices, such as GPS trackers or RFID tags.

### Modeling Signal Variability
- Incorporate factors like signal strength variability and environmental influences into the model.
- Consideration of various environmental conditions that can affect tracking range, like urban vs. rural settings.

### Practical Application
- Ensure the model is adaptable for different types of tracking devices and real-world scenarios.
- Utilize historical data from tracking devices to inform and validate the model.

## Overview of the Methodology
- Our approach involves developing a Markov Chain model to estimate the effective range of tracking devices.
- The model is based on analyzing state transitions that represent different signal strength levels and environmental conditions.

## Methodology Steps
- Data Collection: Gathering historical data from tracking devices, including signal strength, location, and environmental variables.
- State Definition: Defining discrete states within the Markov Chain model, such as varying levels of signal strength.
- Transition Probabilities: Calculating the probabilities of transitioning between these states based on the collected data.
- Range Estimation: Using the Markov Chain to simulate and predict the deviceâ€™s range under different conditions.

### We used an example of Wildlife monitoring in which we estimate the effective range of GPS tracking devices used in monitoring wildlife in a national park.
The park includes diverse environments such as dense forests, open grasslands, and rocky terrain.
